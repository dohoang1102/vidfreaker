This is an old old old project. A few folks have asked for it to be reincarnated for snowleopard.

It took me a while to wipe all the dust off, and put an MIT license on it.

It seems to work on 10.6 now.

I basically checked in the entire xcode directory, only ignoring the build directories.

There are better practices for sharing xcode
projects on github I am sure, so please let me know.
